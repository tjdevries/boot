#include <stdio.h>
//^^^^^^ This is an "include" which is similar in some ways
//       to import in Python. We will cover some of the other
//       standard library includes later, but for now we will
//       include "stdio.h" which is used for:
//       "standard input and output".
//
//       This is how we get our `printf` function that we use below.

// TODO: How much to explain below? Should we have already explained some
// of the syntax before? They have already written quite a bit of Python,
// so they are at least familiar with running a program by now.
//
// Will need to do some exploration on what we can expect by this point.
int main() {
  printf("Hello, world!\n");
  return 0;
