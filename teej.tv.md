# `teej.tv`

About Me:
- Although I'm not a huge fan of the term "Content Creator" I have recently gone full-time on making content. You can find all the links below for that.

I'm currently working on a course for [boot.dev](https://boot.dev/teej) which you can read more about here: [[courses/C/Outline]].
- Don't forget to use promo code `TEEJ` for 25% off :)

Links in Bio:
- [teej_dv](https://youtube.com/@teej_dv): Primary channel with coherent content
- [teej_daily](https://youtube.com/@teej_daily): Secondary channel with the results from stream.
- [ùïè dot com](https://x.com/teej_dv): Only serious posts here
- [twitch.tv/teej_dv](https://twitch.tv/teej_dv): Yes, I stream, btw
