### How did I find out about boot.dev?
- Found Lane on the Twitters and thought he was really funny
- He invited me to be the first guest on Backend Banter, liked him a lot and thought what he was trying to do on boot.dev was really cool  (I like when people have fun and want others to have fun)
- When I was thinking about going full-time streaming/content, I reached out to Lane to talk to him about some stuff and we decided it would be really fun to partner and make some sweet courses together!
