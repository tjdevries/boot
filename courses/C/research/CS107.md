- Understand the "paradigm" that C represents
	- Imperative/Procedural 
	- Regularly starts with a verb
	- Function names give you a strong verb
	- Program via side effects
		- Return value doesn't necessarily tell you much about the data/transformations
- Compare to C++
	- Object oriented
	- "object->something()"
	- Object comes first

Good idea to go over size of all basic types that we'll encounter in C (or at least, the generally expected sizes)
- bool, char, short, int, long, float, double

This could go pretty early in the curriculum, because I'm pretty sure they've never thought about this up until now!

"binary digit" => bit
- Can store a zero or one

8 bits => byte
- 2^8 => 256 values


Float representation?
- I think it's a bit far afield from what I want, but it would be kind of nice to show why we can't have infinite precision for floats...
	- And why you shouldn't use them to store money haha
