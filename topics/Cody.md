The `sg` stands for Sourcegraph :)

I used to work at Sourcegraph before I left for full-time streaming. But!! We decided it'd be good if I could still do some work on `sg.nvim`, so I'll be doing one or two streams a week where I get to work on that and they're sponsoring the work (since it's open source!).
