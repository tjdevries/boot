# Object Introduction

Objects in C?!

I know, you're thinking: "How can this possibly be?!"

Well, it's not Objects **for** C, it's Objects built **in** C.

And we're not going to be building Classes, just Objects*.


* The distinction being, we are not going to build inheritance, methods, etc. Just one data type (`object_t`) that can hold many different kinds of data (`int`, `float`, `tuple`, and more!).
